# Advent of Code Challenge

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

A puzzle is released every day throughout December and they progressively get more difficult and time consuming. The quicker you can solve the puzzles the higher you place on the leaderboard. The highest placed person on the Argo leaderboard will get some AoC merch!

Join the Argo 2024 leaderboard using the code `4224908-4d19ea61`.
